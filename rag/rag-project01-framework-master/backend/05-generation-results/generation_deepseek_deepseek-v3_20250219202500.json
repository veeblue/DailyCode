  "response": "GRPO stands for **Group Relative Policy Optimization**, a method introduced by Shao et al. in 2024 to reduce the training costs of Reinforcement Learning (RL). GRPO eliminates the need for a critic model, which is typically the same size as the policy model, by estimating the baseline from group scores instead. \n\nHere’s how it works: For each question \\( q \\), GRPO samples a group of outputs \\( \\{o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_G\\} \\) from the old policy \\( \\pi_{\\theta_{old}} \\). It then optimizes the policy model \\( \\pi_{\\theta} \\) by maximizing a specific objective function that leverages these group scores. This approach reduces computational overhead by avoiding the use of a separate critic model while still enabling effective policy optimization.",
