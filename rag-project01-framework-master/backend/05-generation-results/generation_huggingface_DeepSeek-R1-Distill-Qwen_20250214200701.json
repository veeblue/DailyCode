  "response": "根据上下文，问题“What is GRPO”可以由上下文中的“Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL”和“Specifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · · , 𝑜𝐺} from the old policy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective”得出。因此，GRPO指的是通过群组得分的平均来估计基准，从而优化政策的方法。因此，问题的答案是GRPO是Group Relative Policy Optimization，用于减少RL训练成本的方法，基于上文中的信息，可以确定这是一个优化方法，用于减少RL的训练成本。\n</think>\n\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an optimization method introduced by Shao et al. (2024) to reduce the training costs of reinforcement learning (RL). It avoids the need for a critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model by estimating the baseline based on group scores. Specifically, for each question \\( q \\), GRPO samples a group of outputs \\( \\{o_1, o_2, \\ldots, o_G\\} \\) from the old policy \\( \\pi_{\\text{old}} \\) and optimizes the policy model \\( \\pi \\) to maximize the following objective.\n\nTherefore, the answer is GRPO is Group Relative Policy Optimization, a method used to reduce the training costs of RL by estimating the baseline from group scores.\n\n\\boxed{GRPO}",
